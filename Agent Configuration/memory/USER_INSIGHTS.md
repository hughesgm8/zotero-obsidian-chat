# User Insights

## Background
- Avid Obsidian user with many plugins installed; familiar with what good plugins look like (Copilot as primary reference)
- First time building an Obsidian plugin
- Comfortable experimenting with local LLMs (Ollama, primarily DeepSeek models)
- Has the Zotero MCP server already set up and working with Claude Desktop

## Working Style
- Prefers explanations of *why* behind decisions, not just what to do
- Will push back when something doesn't make sense  wants clarity over false agreement
- Thinks about accessibility from the start  wants the plugin to work for people without paid API access

## Communication Preferences
- Appreciates when complexity is broken down clearly
- Uses existing tools (like Copilot) as reference points for UX expectations
- Comfortable with technical discussion but benefits from context on new concepts

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Reference Obsidian Copilot when discussing UI patterns  it's the mental model
- When proposing architecture, explain tradeoffs rather than just recommending
- Keep accessibility (free/local model support) as a first-class concern, not an afterthought
